# Agnostic Path Search
This is a simple single-thread pathfinding algorithm that is separated from the graph type it operates on. The algorithm does require the data types to implement the IPathNode and IPathGraph interfaces.  I've found myself frequently making different projects that all require some form of pathing to be run on different graph implementations. The goal of this project is to offload the intricacies of pathing algorithms from the data types themselves, so that I can more easily and quickly make the graph what I want it to be without getting bogged down with debugging a pathing algorithm.
